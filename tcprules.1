.TH tcprules 1
.SH NAME
tcprules \- compile rules for tcpserver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tcprules
.I rules.cdb
.I rules.tmp
.SH OVERVIEW
.B tcpserver
optionally follows rules to decide whether a TCP connection is acceptable.
For example, a rule of

.EX
   18.23.0.32:deny
.EE

prohibits connections from IP address 18.23.0.32.

.B tcprules
reads rules from its standard input
and writes them into
.I rules.cdb
in a binary format suited
for quick access by
.BR tcpserver .

.B tcprules
can be used while
.B tcpserver
is running:
it ensures that
.I rules.cdb
is updated atomically.
It does this by first writing the rules to
.I rules.tmp
and then moving
.I rules.tmp
on top of
.IR rules.cdb .
If
.I rules.tmp
already exists, it is destroyed.
The directories containing
.I rules.cdb
and
.I rules.tmp
must be writable to
.BR tcprules ;
they must also be on the same filesystem.

If there is a problem with the input,
.B tcprules
complains and leaves
.I rules.cdb
alone.

The binary
.I rules.cdb
format is portable across machines.
.SH "RULE FORMAT"
A rule takes up one line.
A file containing rules
may also contain comments: lines beginning with # are ignored.

Each rule contains an
.BR address ,
a colon,
and a list of
.BR instructions ,
with no extra spaces.
When
.B tcpserver
receives a connection from that address,
it follows the instructions.
.SH "ADDRESSES"
.B tcpserver
starts by looking for a rule with address
.IR TCPREMOTEINFO\fB@\fITCPREMOTEIP .
If it doesn't find one, or if
.I TCPREMOTEINFO
is not set, it tries the address
.IR TCPREMOTEIP .
If that doesn't work, it tries shorter and shorter prefixes of
.I TCPREMOTEIP
ending with a dot.
If none of them work, it tries the empty string.

For example, here are some rules:

.EX
   joe@127.0.0.1:first
.br
   18.23.0.32:second
.br
   127.:third
.br
   :fourth
.EE

If
.I TCPREMOTEIP
is
.BR 10.119.75.38 ,
.B tcpserver
will follow the
.B fourth
instructions.

If
.I TCPREMOTEIP
is
.BR 18.23.0.32 ,
.B tcpserver
will follow the
.B second
instructions.

If
.I TCPREMOTEINFO
is
.B bill
and
.I TCPREMOTEIP
is
.BR 127.0.0.1 ,
.B tcpserver
will follow the
.B third
instructions.

If
.I TCPREMOTEINFO
is
.B joe
and
.I TCPREMOTEIP
is
.BR 127.0.0.1 ,
.B tcpserver
will follow the
.B first
instructions.
.SH "ADDRESS RANGES"
.B tcprules
treats
.B 1.2.3.37-53:ins
as an abbreviation
for the rules
.BR 1.2.3.37:ins ,
.BR 1.2.3.38:ins ,
and so on up through
.BR 1.2.3.53:ins .
Similarly,
.BR 10.2-3.:ins
is an abbreviation for
.B 10.2.:ins
and
.BR 10.3.:ins .
.SH "INSTRUCTIONS"
The instructions in a rule must begin with either
.B allow
or
.BR deny .
.B deny
tells
.B tcpserver
to drop the connection without running anything.
For example, the rule

.EX
   :deny
.EE

tells
.B tcpserver
to drop all connections that aren't handled by more specific rules.

The instructions may continue with some environment variables,
in the format
.IR ,VAR="VALUE" .
.B tcpserver
adds
.I VAR=VALUE
to the current environment.
For example,

.EX
   10.0.:allow,RELAYCLIENT="@fix.me"
.EE

adds
.B RELAYCLIENT=@fix.me
to the environment.
The quotes here may be replaced by any repeated character:

.EX
   10.0.:allow,RELAYCLIENT=/@fix.me/
.EE

Any number of variables may be listed:

.EX
   127.0.0.1:allow,RELAYCLIENT="",TCPLOCALHOST="movie.edu"
.EE
.SH "SEE ALSO"
tcprulescheck(1),
tcpserver(1),
tcp-environ(5)
